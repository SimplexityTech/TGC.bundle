# Requirements

For now, this PLEX Agent requires urllib/urllib2 and BeautifulSoup to run.

# INSTALL

Download the complete contents of this git project (git clone) and copy the bundle (TGC.bundle) to your PLEX plug-ins directory.
The appropriate plug-ins directory can be found on the PLEX website (https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201106098-How-do-I-find-the-Plug-Ins-folder-)

# Usage

Rename your course to filenames of the type:

FULL COURSE NAME S01E## Some Text.ext

where E## is the lecture number. The Full Course name **should** be taken from TGC website.
The files **must** be renamed properly for this Agent to pull the data from TGC website.

Example:

Games People Play: Game Theory in Life, Business, and Beyond S01E01 The World of Game Theory.mp4

or

Change and Motion: Calculus Made Clear, 2nd Edition S01E10 Blah.avi

Create a TV Shows Library in PLEX and set the primary agent to TGC. 
Add directories *individually* (not directories of directories) to your library and enjoy!
